      <h6>Resume and Interviews</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Resume: It is seen by mainly three people: HR, Interviewer, ATS. We
          have to tailor it according to all three of them. First ATS scans it
          then HR and finally interviewer. ATS parses our resume and keywords
          are extracted, need an ATS friendly resume. Keep a skills section in
          resume with the keywords. Give proper headings, not random headings or
          complicated jargons. <br />
          Recruiter: they do not understad ou projects so, . Skills are looked
          at first, prepare your resume for what you want to be and not what you
          are meaning if applying for react developer then react should be first
          in skills even if you are a pro angular developer. Second part looked
          at is experience/ college graduation year. Then third part is work
          experience, put some keyowrds in this too. Lastly is contact info must
          have.
          <br />
          Interviewers: They are of two type: technical and manager. <br />
          Technical interviewer will look for projects, skills and work. In
          projects, recent and challenging projects, tech stacks, skills section
          should have more things like redux, tailwind etc, these depth tech
          stacks will be understood by technical interviwer and not hr. If good
          experienced developer like 4-5 years or more no need of college
          projects and stuff. Also if it is like 3rd or 4th company. then keep
          few/less lines for 1st and 2nd company. Put down good technical
          keywords, ex: Built a youtube clone (not good), Built a large scale,
          high performance video streaming platform (sounds so good). keywords:
          fast loading, scalable, high speed, performant, highly optimized
          responsive design. Tell interviewer what all you have done in
          projects, like used tailwind, it will trigger more ques like why
          tailwind its pros and cons etc. <br />
          Manager: They will check if you have good communication skills, if you
          are shy to talk etc. Some keywords: led a project, developed app from
          scratch, taken ownership, code coverage, code quality, mentored other
          people, collaboration, curious to learn. Some technical ques etc.
          <br />
          These things should be enough in resume, unnecessary things are not
          required like hobbies, random achievements, address, photo, summary
          section/objectives (passionate engineer and all that random stuff).
          Anything on resume write only if it impacts any of the three: ATS, HR,
          Interviewer. Always keep it one page, no excessive pages required it
          will always be something unnecessary, even if we are highly
          experienced.

          Interviews: <br />
          Your introduction is always asked you should be prepared for it, dont
          learn it and spit it out like a robot. If someone said your name then
          why to repeat it by saying Hi I am Aditya, never say your name.
          Introduce yourself by top down approach that is start describing high
          level details about projects and what/where you are working on.
          company --- team --- project. If the interviewer is not interrupting
          you, add more details, talk about more things/ technologies, more
          projects etc. Dont stop by yourself, stop when interviewer stops. Dont
          learn it and recite it, keep it as a discussion. Keep few things
          ready, like challenging things, your impact etc. If interview with
          manager, talk more about that stuff - leading people, collaboration
          etc. Talk about stuff for which the role is, if frontend engineer
          switching to backend then talk about the backend stuff more (projects
          etc). Ask good questions towards the end (no irrelevant random ques )
          and dont ask about feedback, use the time to know more about the
          team/company, ask the interviewer about what he is working on, tech
          stack etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Salary negotiation: Prepare for it, hr is ready to hire you for less
          salary we should negotiate it well. There is always a scope for
          increment when we get the first offer letter, it is up to us to get
          that increment by negotiating. first offer is generally at the lower
          end of the range of the budget. Tell your expectation, if it out of
          their range then ask for their range. It is not unprofessional to
          negotiate your salary, ask what you deserve and max 30% increment is
          not true. Dont fall into those traps where hr says you will be
          promoted soon or you will get a big raise soon. ESOPS should be
          ignored focus on base salary, only listed company stocks can be
          traded. Be confident, dont say industry standard etc, just say I want
          this amount. Never look for a percentage hike, go for a fixed number.

      <h6>Personal Branding</h6>: check the linkedin masterclass video start
      too.
      <h6>LinkedIn masterclass:</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Have a good profile picture as it matters a lot, a good and unique
          bio, start a post with catchy line something on reading will make
          reader want to read more. Be active (like, comment post) and not dead,
          otherwise linkedin algo wont help you, like if you just read and
          close. After posting, 1 hour decides what our reach will be, our post
          will go to the feed of connections especially most active ones. If we
          are not active why will linkedin make an effort to show us posts. If
          the active connections show good response (likes etc) then the post
          will go to more people among connections. If that also responds well
          then the post goes to the connections network (2nd level). If 2nd
          level likes then the reach will increase even more. If initial
          response not good then post will not be promoted. Dont post random
          stuff, find the target audience and write accordingly. Show your
          intent on the profile what you are trying to do. feature your posts,
          about section is like a pitch write it well. Fill the profile with
          keywords (javascript, react etc.)
